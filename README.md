# Natural Language Processing with Transformers

This is repository based on
[nlp-with-transformers](https://github.com/nlp-with-transformers/). It contains
some of my own notes as I read through the book and work through the code. Since
I use an Apple Sillicon computer, I also modified the dependencies to work on M1
/ M2 machines.

## MacOS with M1 or M2 processors

> Assuming Python3 is already installed.

```bash
brew install h5fs
python3 -m venv ./venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
```
