Upon receipt of my order on Oct 22, 2015, a technician in California received a replacement of the order and a message from a friend from North Carolina asking for an extra free package of her own. I immediately received mine from her, and she subsequently forwarded it back to you, which you responded with, \"Yes, in person, to our knowledge.\" She also received my email from your address as instructed. As your message indicated, when she requested an exchange of the Optimus Prime action figure she requested an exchange of the actual action figure for my service. My second order on Dec. 16, 2014 was handled by the guy you indicated for service. Unfortunately, he was in Texas on business, where you have no public contact. It is for this reason that I apologize to you for the confusion this can cause. In light of this, I apologize to you for the inconvenience I have caused you.\n",
